If the `date` argument was not passed, the function return the `string` `'Unable to determine the time of year!'`. If the `date` argument is **invalid**, the function will throw an `Error` with message `Invalid date!`.

For example:

`const springDate = new Date(2024, 03, 31)`

`getSeason(springDate)` => `'spring'`
